I need a bike fitting but Paragon Fit Studio is totally booked! Bummer!

Writing a quick script to make a request to their booking page every 5-10 minutes or so to check for availability.

If there is availability, then I will notify myself with (ntfy.sh)[https://github.com/dschep/ntfy].

I am not yet sure how I'm going to deploy, I'm not used to being a script kiddie, nor Docker.
